## General

- **What is CSS?**  
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and format a webpage written in HTML or XML.

- **How to Add Style to an Element:**  
  Styles can be added using:
  1. Inline styles (within an HTML tag).  
  2. Internal CSS (inside a `<style>` block in the HTML file).  
  3. External CSS (linked via a `.css` file).

- **What is a Class?**  
  A class is a reusable style definition that can be applied to multiple elements using the `class` attribute.

- **What is a Selector?**  
  A selector is a pattern used to target elements for styling in CSS (e.g., `.class`, `#id`, `div`).

- **How to Compute CSS Specificity Value:**  
  Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element. The hierarchy is:  
  1. Inline styles  
  2. ID selectors  
  3. Class selectors  
  4. Element selectors

- **What are Box Properties in CSS?**  
  Box properties include:
  - **Margin**: Space outside the element.  
  - **Border**: Surrounds the padding and content.  
  - **Padding**: Space between content and border.  
  - **Content**: The main area where text or images appear.

- **How Does the Browser Load a Webpage?**  
  1. Parses HTML and builds the DOM (Document Object Model).  
  2. Fetches and applies CSS to style elements.  
  3. Executes JavaScript for interactivity.  
  4. Renders the final webpage for the user.
