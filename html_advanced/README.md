## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/tk1bYe9n6YmcEsF-gwOgMA "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What is HTML
-   How to create an HTML page from a wireframe
-   What is a markup language
-   What is the DOM
-   What is an element / tag
-   What is an attribute
-   What the purpose of each HTML tag

## Requirements

### General

-   All your files should end with a new line
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
-   You are  **not allowed**  to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be build with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
-   Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with  [W3C-Validator](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/czWaAX6ZYwSLoR3bh2Qiqg "W3C-Validator")


## What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web content. It defines the structure of a webpage using elements or "tags" like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

## Creating an HTML Page from a Wireframe
1. **Analyze the Wireframe**: Identify content like sections, images, and navigation.
2. **Set Up HTML Structure**: Create a basic HTML document with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
3. **Add Elements**: Use tags such as `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to structure the page.
4. **Test and Refine**: View the page in a browser and adjust the layout. Use CSS for styling.

## What is a Markup Language?
A markup language defines content structure and presentation using tags. HTML is one of the most common markup languages.

## What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?
The DOM represents the structure of a web document as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to modify the document's content dynamically.

## What is an Element / Tag?
An **element** is a complete HTML component, e.g., `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`. A **tag** is the HTML code that defines an element, like `<p>` (start) and `</p>` (end).

## What is an Attribute?
An **attribute** provides additional information about an element, e.g., `<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>`, where `href` is an attribute.

## Key HTML Tags and Their Purposes:
- **`<html>`**: Root element of the document.
- **`<head>`**: Contains metadata and links to stylesheets.
- **`<title>`**: Sets the page title in the browser tab.
- **`<body>`**: Contains visible content.
- **`<h1>` to `<h6>`**: Headings of varying importance.
- **`<p>`**: Paragraph of text.
- **`<a>`**: Hyperlink.
- **`<img>`**: Embeds an image.
- **`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`**: Lists (unordered, ordered, and list items).
- **`<div>`**: Defines a section or container.
- **`<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`**: Elements for user input.

Each tag is used to define and structure different content on a webpage.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure all files are properly formatted, including ending each file with a new line.
- Follow all project requirements and validate your code to ensure it meets W3C standards.
